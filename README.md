Each part of our experiment is in a separate folder.
ALL codes are run using Python 3.6.
ALSbySpark.py is run on Cloudera VM.
The dataset for ALS is provided as a zip folder inside the folder "ALS"
The datasets for the other codes are named inside the scripts the way they are on the MovieLens repository.
Please don't forget to edit the file paths of the data in the scripts.
